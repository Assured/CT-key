## Toolchain

The toolchain is setup by gcc-riscv, litex framework and Yosys and everything is already isolated to a Docker container that can be used as a development environment in VSC. Just clone the repo and reopen the folder in container and it will create the development environment with all tools needed for development in C (RISCV), Python and synthesing code for FPGA for ECP5.
